# Instructions

1) Start GraphHopper (v2.0 should do). Feel free to adjust or remove zoom limits of GraphHopper's /mvt endpoint or checkout https://github.com/easbar/graphhopper/releases/tag/gh_maps_experiments_v1
2) Open one of the `index.html` files in your browser

# Features

* Experiments for Mapbox GL JS and OpenLayers
* Render the map using Raster or Vector Tiles
* Render GraphHopper graph using /mvt endpoint
* Render the shortest path tree for a given time-radius
* Mapbox only: Render isochrones for a given time-radius
* Mapbox only: Use deck.gl to render the shortest path tree or ischrone
